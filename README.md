# Society of Alin - Project

---

This project is a full stack social media application built with the MERN stack. In terms of features, a user can register, log in, create new posts, like other posts, add friends, and so on.

Other technologies used include Redux, MUI, and JWT.

This was accomplished with the assistance of Ed Roh.
